# HeartBeat-Tracking
A demo for implementing a heartbeat tracking system using Arduino and MATLAB with ROS2.


---

## Introduction

The prototype design is primarily derived from the concepts outlined in this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8833632). It incorporates Arduino Tool Kits, including a microcontroller board, servo motor, LEDs, and an ultrasonic sensor. ROS2 is utilized for data transmission, enabling the robot end-effector to track heartbeat motion with the collected sensor data.
